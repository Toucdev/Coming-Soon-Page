# Basic Coming Soon Page.

**Made by Toucdev**

Once upon a time, I was bored in class. I made this cool coming soon page.
I made this on a school chromebook with an online text editor called StackBlitz.

**Features:**
- Text that says "Coming Soon." (Uses google Roboto font).
- The backround will very slowly change to a light shade of purple and then change back to white.
- Button that will take you to this GitHub repo. 
- Same button will change when you hover over it.

**Usage and Contribution:**

Feel free to this as a template for whatever you want.
Credit is not required but would be nice. 

If you would like to contribute, feel free.

**Future Features:**
Check the "Issues" tab.
